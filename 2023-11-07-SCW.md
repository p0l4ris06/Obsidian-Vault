# Transcriptional level control
## [[Transcription]] factors in [[Eukaryotic cells]]
Example: [[Lac operon]] in [[Lactose]]
### Without transcription factors: 
- RNA polymerase [[Enzyme]] cannot bind to [[Proteins]] 
- No transcription of Gene A

### With transcription factors: 
- Transcription factors bind at the [[Distal control region]]
- Genome loops and crosslinks at the promoter 
- RNA polymerase enzyme binds to the promoter
- Transcription takes place

##### Transcription makes **Primary [[mRNA]]**
# Post-transcriptional level control
