## Recycling within [[Ecosystem]]s
[[Bacteria]] and [[Fungi]] involved in decomposition feed in a different way from animals. They feed saprotrophically, so they are described as [[Saprotrophs]]. The steps in saprotrophic decomposition are:
1. Saprotrophs secrete [[Enzyme]]s onto dead and waste material
2. Enzymes digest the material into small molecules which are then absorbed into the saprotroph's body
3. Having been absorbed, the molecules are stored or respired to release energy

## Recycling nitrogen
Living things need nitrogen to make [[Proteins]] and [[Nucleic acids]]. Bacteria are involved in ammonification, nitrogen fixation, nitrification and denitrification.

### Nitrogen fixation
Plants need a supply of fixed nitrogen such as [[Ammonium]] ions (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) or nitrate ions (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). Nitrogen fixation can occur through lightning strikes or the [[Haber process]]. Most of the fixed nitrogen is supplied by nitrogen-fixing [[Bacteria]]. *Azotobacter* are bacteria that live freely in the soil and fix nitrogen gas, using it to manufacture [[Amino acids]]. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as *Rhizobium* also live in the root nodules of plants such as peas, beans and clover which are all members of the bean family. The bacteria use an [[Enzyme]] called nitrogen reductase to reduce nitrogen gas to ammonium ions that can be used by the host plants
