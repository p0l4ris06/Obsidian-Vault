## Recycling within [[Ecosystem]]s
[[Bacteria]] and [[Fungi]] involved in decomposition feed in a different way from animals. They feed saprotrophically, so they are described as [[Saprotrophs]]. The steps in saprotrophic decomposition are:
1. Saprotrophs secrete [[Enzyme]]s onto dead and waste material
2. Enzymes digest the material into small molecules which are then absorbed into the saprotroph's body
3. Having been absorbed, the molecules are stored or respired to re
