### [[Oxidative phosphorylation]] and the [[chemiosmotic theory]]
[[Chemiosmosis]]

#### The final stage of Aerobic [[Respiration]]
1. Reduced [[NAD]] and reduced [[FAD]] are reoxidised when they deliver their Hydrogen atoms to the electron transport chain
2. The Hydrogens released from the reduced [[Coenzymes]] split into [[Proton]]s and [[Electron]]s
3. The [[Proton]]s go into solution in the mitochondrial [[Matrix]]

#### The electron transport chain
- The [[Electron]]s from the hydrogen atoms pass along the chain of electron carriers. Each electron carrier [[Proteins]] has an iron ion at its core. The iron ions
