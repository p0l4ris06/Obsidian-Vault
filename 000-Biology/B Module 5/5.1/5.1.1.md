## Survival and activity
All living things need to maintain a certain limited set of conditions inside their cells. These include:
- A suitable temperature
- A suitable [[pH]]
- An aqueous environment that keeps [[Substrate]]s and products in solution
- Freedom from toxins and excess inhibitors

## Cell signalling
The two major systems of communication that work by cell signalling are: 
#### The neuronal system
An interconnected network of [[Neurones]] that signal to eachot
