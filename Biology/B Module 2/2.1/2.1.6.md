- [[Gene]] that has the coded instructions for one of the [[Proteins]] such as insulin is transcribed into a length of [[RNA]] called [[mRNA]] 
- Many copies of this mRNA are made and they pass out of the pores in the nuclear envelope to the [[Ribosomes]]
- The insulin molecules pass into the cisternae of the [[RER]] and along these hollow sacs
- Vesicles with insulin inside are pinched off from the RER and pass via microtubules and motor proteins to the golgi apparatus
