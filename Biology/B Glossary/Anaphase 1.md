The members of the pair of [[Homologous chromosomes]] are pulled apart by motor proteins that drag them along the tubulin threads of the spindle 
The centromeres do not divide and each chromosome consists of two chromatids
The crossed-over areas separate from each other resulting in areas of swapped [[allele]]s (shuffling)
Anaphase 1 leads to [[Telophase 1]]
