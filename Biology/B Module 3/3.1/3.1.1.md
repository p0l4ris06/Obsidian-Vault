Plants need to take carbon dioxide and nutrients in

[[Water]] products generated need to be released

The location within an organism where this exchange occurs is called an **exchange site**

Large organisms require specialised transport systems as transport distance increases, [[SA:V ratio]] increases and level of activity increases

Every cell in a plant requires [[Water]], glucose and mineral ions

The roots take in mineral ions while the leaves photosynthesise to produce glucose

Glucose is transported as sucrose in plants

As size of an organism increases, [[SA:V ratio]] decreases

Single celled organisms have a high [[SA:V ratio]] which allows exchange of substances to occur via simple diffusion

Adaptations of plants to increase [[SA:V ratio]]:

- Branching body shape
- Leaves are flat and thin
- Roots have root hairs
