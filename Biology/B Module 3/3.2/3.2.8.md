[[Carbonic anhydrase]]

[[Haemoglobinic acid]]

##### Role of [[Haemoglobin]]
- 5% of carbon dioxide is dissolved directly into the [[Plasma]]
- 10% is combined directly with haemoglobin to form a compound called carbaminohaemoglobin
- 85% is transported in the form of hydrogencarbonate ions

Carbon dioxide in the blood plasma diffuses into the red [[blood]] cells. Here it combines with water to form a weak acid called carbonic acid. This reaction is catalysed by the [[Enzyme]] carbonic anhydrase. 
This carbonic acid dissociates to release hydrogen ions and hydrogencarbonate ions.
The hydrogencarbonate ions diffuse out if th
