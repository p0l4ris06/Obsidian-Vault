[[Callose]]
## Physical barriers in plants:
- Bark: contains [[Tannins]] which inhibit digestion in insects
- Waxy cuticle: stops [[Water]] collecting on the leaf preventing water transmission of [[pathogen]]s
- [[Cellulose]] cell wall: makes it harder for pathogens to get inside a cell 
- Lignin thickening of cell walls: waterproof and almost completely indigestible
- [[Stomata]]l closure
[[Callose]]: deposited in sieve tubes around the sieve plates and blocks the flow of [[Phloem]] in the sieve tube preventing a [[Pathogen]] from spreading around a plant

[[Tylose]] forms in the xylem and is present as a passive defence. The plant actively produces more when under threat. Blocks [[Xylem]]

Oxidative bursts: release of oxygen to damage/kill anaerobic pathogens

Terpenoids: antibacterial

Phenol: antibacterial properties

Alkaloids: bitter taste - inhibit [[enzyme]] action

Defensins: antimicrobial - inhibit ion transport [[proteins]]

Hydrolytic enzymes: chitinases - breakdown chitin cell walls; glucanses - hydrolyse glucans; lysosomes - breakdown bacterial cell walls
