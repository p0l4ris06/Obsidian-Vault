Physical barriers in plants:

- Bark: contains tannins which inhibit digestion in insects
- Waxy cuticle: stops water collecting on the leaf preventing water transmission of pathogens
- Cellulose cell wall: makes it harder for pathogens to get inside a cell
- Lignin thickening of cell walls: waterproof and almost completely indigestible

Stomatal closure

Callose: deposited in sieve tubes around the sieve plates and blocks the flow of phloem in the sieve tube preventing a pathogen from spreading around a plant

Tylose forms in the xylem and is present as a passive defence. The plant actively produces more when under threat. Blocks xylem

Tyloses and tannins: bitter tasting (terpenes - bitter tasting/toxic)

Oxidative bursts: release of oxygen to damage/kill anaerobic pathogens

Terpenoids: antibacterial

Phenol: antibacterial properties

Tannins: prevent enzyme action - inhibits growth of herbivore

Alkaloids: bitter taste - inhibit enzyme action

Defensins: antimicrobial - inhibit ion transport proteins

Hydrolytic enzymes: chitinases - breakdown chitin cell walls; glucanses - hydrolyse glucans;
lysosomes - breakdown bacterial cell walls

Phagocytosis: non-specific secondary response

Neutrophils: small, short lived

Macrophages: larger/long lived, antigen presentation

1) Engulf:

- Pathogen bound to the neutrophil
- Cytoskeleton: microtubules change the shape of the cell
- Pseudopodia

2) Pathogen is contained in a vesicle called a phagosome

3) Lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes and fuse to the phagosome to produce a:

4) Phagolysome

5) Digestion of the pathogen takes place

6) Waste is released by exocytosis

7) Macrophages: carry out antigen presentation - pathogenâ€™s antigens placed on the outside of the macrophage
