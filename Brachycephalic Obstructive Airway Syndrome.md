# What it affects
Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS) affects the French Bulldog, Bulldog, Pug, Pekingese, Shih Tzu, Japanese Chin, Boxer and Boston terrier are all examples of BOAS breeds. The most distinctive feature of these breeds is their short muzzle

Breeding selection for extreme brachycephalic features has resulted in dogs that are predisposed to upper airway tract obstruction and subsequent respiratory distress, amongst various other health issues.

## Pathophysiology
#### Anatomical components:
##### Shortening of the skull and upper airway tract lesions
- In brachycephalic dogs, while the length of the skeletal muzzle is reduced there is often no corresponding decrease in the size of the soft tissue contained in the skull. This results in a constricted effect within the nasal cavity and partial obstruction of the pharynx and larynx

##### Upper airway tract obstruction and poor thermoregulation
- Excessive selection for brachycephaly has deformed the upper airway tract and resulted in obstructions. Affected brachycephalic dogs must increase their inspiratory effort to overcome the resistance generated by the upper airway obstruction and thus achieve sufficient ventilation
