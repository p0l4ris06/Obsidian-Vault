# Enzymes (2.4.1 - 2.4.9)

Cofactor: a substance that has to be present to ensure that an enzyme-catalysed reaction takes place at the appropriate rate

Cl⁻ is a cofactor for amylase and Zn²⁺ is a prosthetic group for carbonic anhydrase

Prosthetic groups: a cofactor that is permanently bound by covalent bonds to an enzyme molecule

Coenzymes: small organic non-protein molecules that bind ********temporarily******** to the active site of enzyme molecules, either just before or at the same time that the substrate binds. The coenzymes are chemically changed during the reaction and they need to be recycled to their original state, sometimes by a different enzyme

Vitamins are a source of coenzymes

NAD and NADP (Nicotinamide, B₃) are hydrogen acceptors and are both derivatives of nucleotides (see more in 2.3.1)

When the substrate molecules fit into the enzyme’s active site, the active site changes shape slightly to mould itself around the substrate molecule, this is the induced fit hypothesis

The active site still has a shape complementary to the shape of the substrate molecule. But, on binding, there are changes in the R groups of amino acids that result in the active site having a more precise shape that complements the substrate molecule exactly

Enzymes speed up the rate of reaction by lowering the activation energy

Q₁₀: the temperature coefficient. (T+10)/T

Heat increases the kinetic energy of molecules, therefore speeding up the rate of successful reactive collisions between molecules. It also increases the force with which they collide

Optimum temperature is when the rate of reaction is at its maximum

Heat may also cause some weak bonds to break, such as hydrogen and ionic bonds that are part of an enzymes tertiary structure of its active site

This causes the active site to denature so the substrate molecules are not complementary, this means that the rate of reaction decreases

Michaelis-Menten Kinetics

Kₘ: Substrate concentration that gives a rate of reaction equal to half of Vₘₐₓ

Excess hydrogen ions will interfere with hydrogen bonds and ionic forces in enzymes, causing the active site of the enzyme molecule to change shape. If the substrate molecule doesn’t fit the active site then the rate of reaction that the enzyme catalyses will be lowered

Increasing the concentration of hydrogen ions will also alter the charges on the active site of enzyme molecules, as more will cluster around negatively charged groups (e.g. amino acid R-groups) in the active site. This interferes with the substrate molecule binding to the active site

Organic acids are proton donors: Lactic acid dissociates into H⁺ and lactate, pyruvic acid dissociates into H⁺ and pyruvate

Buffer: something that resists changes in pH. These buffers can donate or accept hydrogen ions. Some proteins, such as haemoglobin, can also donate or accept protons so act as buffers

Competitive inhibition: inhibition of an enzyme where the inhibitor molecule has a similar shape to a substrate molecule and competes with the substrate for the enzyme’s active site. It blocks the active site and prevents the formation of enzyme-substrate (ES) complexes

Inhibitor: a substance that reduces or stops a reaction

Non-competitive inhibition: inhibition of an enzyme where the competitor molecule attaches to a part of the enzyme molecule but not the active site. This changes the shape of the active site which prevents enzyme-substrate (ES) complexes forming as the active site is no longer complementary in shape to the substrate molecule

Most enzyme inhibition by competitive inhibitors is reversible. As collisions between enzymes and substrate or enzyme and inhibitor are random, increasing the concentration of substrate would reduce the effect of reversible competitive inhibition, as there would be a higher chance that a substrate molecule collides with an enzyme rather than an inhibitor molecule

If a competitive inhibitor binds irreversibly to the enzyme’s active site it is called an inactivator

Non-competitive inhibitors attach to a region called the allosteric site, which is away from the active site and this disrupts the enzyme’s tertiary structure and changes its shape
