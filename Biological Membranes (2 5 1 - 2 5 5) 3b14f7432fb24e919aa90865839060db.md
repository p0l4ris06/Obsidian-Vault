Fluid mosaic model: the theory that cell membrane structure contains proteins embedded in a sea of phospholipids

Glycolipid: lipid/phospholipid with a chain of carbohydrate molecules attached

Glycoprotein: protein with a chain of carbohydrate molecules attached

Plasma membrane: cell surface membrane

Spanning the membrane are various proteins

Some of them have pores and act as channels to allow ions which have an electrical charge and are surrounded by water molecules to pass through

Some proteins are carriers and by changing their shape carry specific molecules across the membrane

Other proteins may be attached to carrier proteins and function as enzymes, antigens or receptor sites for complementary-shaped signalling chemicals such as hormones

Channel and carrier proteins span the whole lipid bilayer - they are integral proteins and their membrane-spanning regions interact with the hydrophobic region of the phospholipid bilayer
