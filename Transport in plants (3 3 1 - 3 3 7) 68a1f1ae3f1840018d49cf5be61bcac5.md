Transpiration: loss of water from leaves by osmosis, evaporation and diffusion

Transpiration stream: flow of water from the roots through the plant to the leaves

1) Active transport of mineral ions from the soil into the root hair cells. Increases the solute concentration, lower (more negative) water potential

2) Water moves into the root hair cells by osmosis

3) The water potential of the root hair cells is higher (less negative) than the xylem vessel. The hydrostatic pressure in the root hair cells is higher than in the xylem. Water moves from the root hair cells to the xylem down the water potential gradient by osmosis through:

4) The vascular pathway

5) The symplastic pathway

6) The apoplastic pathway down the pressure gradient

7) The waxy casparian strip stops water moving through the apoplastic pathway forcing all the water into the pericycle cells by osmosis down the water potential gradient

8) Active transport of mineral ions into the xylem vessels makes the water potential of the xylem lower so water moves into the xylem by osmosis generating root pressure

Water is a polar molecule

Water molecules form hydrogen bonds between each other - cohesion

Water forms a continuous column in the xylem

As water moves out of the xylem in the leaf it pulls other water molecules up that it is hydrogen bonded to

Water is pulled up the xylem from the roots

The column of water acts like elastic - it gets thinner

The adhesion of water to the xylem causes xylem to narrow as well

Lignin stops the xylem from collapsing

Adaptations of xerophytes:

Leaves reduced to spines

- reduces surface area for water loss
- fewer stomata so reduced transpiration
- protect the succulent stems

Sunken Stomata

- stomatal pore in a pit
- a mass of humid air is trapped in the pit
- reduces concentration gradient for water
- less water lost by transpiration

Thick upper and lower epidermis - multiple cell layers

- reduces evaporation of water from the leaf surface

Hairs around stomatal pores

- trap humid air
- reduces concentration gradient for water

Extensive shallow root system and tap root to take up as much water as possible

Some xerophytes can roll their leaves up which traps humid air in the leaf

Adaptations of hydrophytes:

Air spaces in leaves and stems make them buoyant - above water for photosynthesis

Transpiration

- Hydathodes
- release water for evaporation to keep the transpiration stream flowing

Stomata on the upper surface of the leaf for gas exchange

Aerenchyma - hollow tubes from the air to the roots to exchange O2 and CO2 for respiration

Source: any exporting organ

Sinks: any non-photosynthetic organ that does not produce enough photosynthetic products to support their own growth and development

1) Proton pump (active transport) uses ATP to transport H+ from the companion cell into the sieve cell

2) [H+] high in source cell

3) H+ move by facilitated diffusion back into the companion cell through the co-transport pump co- transporting sucrose

4) High [sucrose] in companion cell

5) Sucrose moves via diffusion through the plasmodesmata into the sieve tube element down the concentration gradient as [sucrose] is higher in the companion cell compared to the phloem

6) [Sucrose] in the sieve tube element increases, water potential decreases

7) Water moves into the sieve tube element from the xylem via osmosis through the plasmodesmata down the water potential gradient

8) Volume of water increases, hydrostatic pressure increases

9) Sucrose is turned into starch at the sink, this means [sucrose] is lower

10) Sucrose moves from the sieve tube element into the companion cell into the sink via diffusion

11) Water potential of the sieve tube elements increases

12) Water moves via osmosis from sieve tube elements into the xylem decreasing hydrostatic pressure in the sieve tube element

1) Blue light is absorbed by chlorophyll in chloroplasts producing ATP

2) ATP is used to actively move protons out via a proton pump out of the guard cell

3) K+ ions move into the cell via facilitated diffusion, H+ cotransports sucrose into the guard cell

4) [solute] increases and water potential decreases

5) Water moves into the cell via osmosis down the water potential gradient

6) Guard cells become turgid, stomatal pore opens

When water loss>water uptake:

- Plant produces ABA (hormone)
- ABA stimulates the influx of Ca2+ which stimulates the efflux of Cl-, K+ ([solute] decreases) and water (by osmosis)
- Guard cells become plasmolysed
- Stomatal pore closes
- Water loss reduced
