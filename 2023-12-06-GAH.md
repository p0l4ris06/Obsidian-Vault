# Liver functions:
- Detoxification
- [[Carbohydrates]] metabolism
- [[Proteins]] metabolism
- Fat metabolism
- Vitamin storage
- Mineral storage
- [[Blood]] storage
- Red blood cell manufacturer (Foetus)
- Breakdown of [[Haemoglobin]]
- [[Bile]] production
- [[Cholesterol]] production
- Hormone breakdown

## Carbohydrate metabolism
- [[Insulin]], [[Glucagon]] (Pancreas) and [[Adrenalin]] (Adrenal glands) all affect carbohydrate metabolism in [[The liver]] 
- [[Glycogenesis]]

## Glucagon and insulin
- Released when [[Glucose]] levels fall, it binds to glucoprotein receptors on [[Hepatocyte]]s causing [[Glycogenolysis]] so glucose is released into the [[blood]]
- Adrenalin has a similar effect 
- Insulin has reverse effect when blood glucose rises

## [[Gluconeogenesis]]
- Non-carb molecules e.g, [[Amino acids]], [[pyr]]
