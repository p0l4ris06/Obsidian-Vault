## [[Glycolysis]]: [[Cytoplasm]]
[[Glucose]] --2x[[ATP]]--> Hexose Bisphosphate + 2[[ADP]]
Activates molecule, becomes unstable intermediate
Hexose Bisphosphate ----> 2xTriose Phosphate ([[TP]])
Triose Phosphate ----> (4ADP + P<sub>i</sub> --> 4ATP) 2 x [[Pyruvate]] (2H + [[NAD]] --> 2[[NADH]] ([[Reduction]]))
Removal of Hydrogen atoms: dehydrogenation
NAD is a [[Coenzymes]]

## [[Link reaction]]: [[Matrix]]
[[Active transport]] of [[Pyruvate]] from the [[Cytoplasm]] to the [[Mitochondria]].
Pyruvate ----> (Uses NAD and makes reduced NAD (NADH)) + Acetate + [[Carbon dioxide]]
Acetate + Coenzyme A ----> [[Acetyl CoA]]
- Each pyruvate is decarboxylated and oxidised forming acetatet
