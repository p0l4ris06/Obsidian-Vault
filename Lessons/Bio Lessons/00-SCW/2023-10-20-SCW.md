E. coli respire using [[Glucose]] or [[Lactose]] as the sugar

# Transcriptional level control: [[Lac operon]]
## Presence of Glucose:
- Regulatory gene transcribed into [[mRNA]] and sent to [[Ribosomes]]
- Repressor protein made
- Repressor protein binds to the operator region
- Prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter and transcribing structural genes

## Presence of Lactose:
- Regulatory gene transcribed into [[mRNA]] and sent to [[Ribosomes]]
- Repressor protein made
- If Lactose (inducer) binds to the repressor protein it changes binding site on the protein for binding to lacO (changes [[Tertiary structure]])
- Inducer
