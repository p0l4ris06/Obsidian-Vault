Alpha glucose is used as an energy source. It is a component of starch and glycogen which act as energy stores. This is an example of a hexose sugar

Ribose is a component of RNA, ATP and NAD. Deoxyribose is a component of DNA. They are both pentose sugars

Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen are present in a carbohydrate. Carbohydrates act as a store for energy, as a source of energy and as structural units. Some carbohydrates are also part of other molecules, such as nucleic acids and glycolipids.

Cellulose is made up of a chain of beta glucose molecules

Amylose (in plants): a long chain of alpha glucose molecules. Carbon 1-4 glycosidic bonds. Amylose coils into a spiral shape with hydrogen bonds holding the spiral in place. Hydroxyl groups on carbon 2 are situated on the inside of the coil, making the molecule less soluble and allowing hydrogen bonds to form to maintain the coil’s structure

Amylopectin (in plants): a long chain of alpha glucose molecules. Carbon 1-4 glycosidic bonds and branches formed by glycosidic bonds between carbons 1 and 6. Amylopectin also coils into a spiral shape held together with hydrogen bonds, but with branches emerging from the spiral

Glycogen (in animals): Carbon 1-4 glycosidic bonds and branches formed by glycosidic bonds between carbons 1 and 6. The 1-4 bonded chains tend to be smaller than in amylopectin, so glycogen has less tendency to coil. However, it has more branches, making it more compact. It is also easier to remove monomer units when there are more exposed ends

Maltose: Disaccharide formed by condensation of two glucose molecules

Sucrose: Disaccharide formed by condensation of glucose and fructose

Lactose: Disaccharide formed by condensation of glucose and galactose

Glycogen and starch are both formed by the condensation of alpha glucose 

Cellulose is formed by the condensation of beta glucose

The covalent bond formed between glycerol and the fatty acid is called an ester bond. Triglycerides contain three ester bonds

Amino acid

Primary structure: order and number of amino acids in a protein

Secondary structure: shape that the chain of amino acids takes - either alpha helix or beta pleated sheet. Shape determined by H bonds

Tertiary structure: 3D shape of protein. Globular or fibrous

Quaternary structure: Combination of different proteins

Hydrogen bonds stabilise secondary structure

Phosphorylation: a process in which the synthesis of ATP is coupled with the movement of electrons down the electron transport chain and the consumption of oxygen

Benedict’s test: test for reducing and non-reducing sugars. Blue solution in presence of reducing sugar turns brick red. If not reducing sugar then solution stays blue

Biuret test: test for proteins. Sample placed in test tube and equal amount of NaOH is added. Then dilute copper (II) sulfate solution is added. In presence of protein solution turns lilac as indicator of peptide bonds. If absent then solution stays blue

Emulsion test: test for lipids. Sample added to excess ethanol then water added. Solution turns cloudy if lipid present

Iodine test: test for starch. If starch present then solution turns black/blue. If absent then stay yellow/orange
