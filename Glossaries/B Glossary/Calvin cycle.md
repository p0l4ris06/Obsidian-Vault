In plants, [[Carbon dioxide]] enters the interior of a leaf via pores called [[Stomata]] and diffuses into the [[Stroma]] of the [[Chloroplast]], where sugar is synthesised. Part of the [[Light independent]] reaction. 
Carbon atoms from [[Carbon dioxide]] are fixed and used to build three carbon sugars ([[Pyruvate]]). This process is fuelled by, and dependent on [[ATP]] and [[NADPH]] from the [[Light dependent]] reactions.
Reactions take place in the [[Stroma]]

## Steps of the calvin cycle
- [[Carbon dioxide]] combines with [[RuBP]] (5 Carbons)
- This reaction is catalysed by [[Enzyme]] [[RuBisCO]] 
- This reaction causes the RuBP to be carboxylated which forms an unstable intermediate compound with six carbons
- This unstable six carbon compound immediately breaks down to form two molecules of [[GP]] (3 Carbons)
- This whole process is referred to as **the fixation of carbon dioxide** 
- After carbon dioxide has been fixed, GP is reduced to form [[TP]]
- GP is reduced to TP by using hydrogen atoms from the reduced N
