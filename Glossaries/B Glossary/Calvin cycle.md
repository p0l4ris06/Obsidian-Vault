In plants, [[Carbon dioxide]] enters the interior of a leaf via pores called [[Stomata]] and diffuses into the [[Stroma]] of the [[Chloroplast]], where sugar is synthesised. Part of the [[Light independent]] reaction. 
Carbon atoms from [[Carbon dioxide]] are fixed and used to build three carbon sugars ([[Pyruvate]]). This process is fuelled by, and dependent on [[ATP]] and [[NADPH]] from the [[Light dependent]] reactions.
Reactions take place in the [[Stroma]]

## Steps of the calvin cycle
- [[Carbon dioxide]] combines with [[RuBP]] 
- This reaction is catalysed by
