Electron micrograph: photograph of an image seen using an electron microscope

Magnification: the number of times larger an image appears compared with the size of the object

Organelles: small structures within cells that have a specific function

Photomicrograph: photograph of an image seen using an optical microscope

Resolution: the clarity of an image; the higher the resolution, the clearer the image

Rough ER: series of flattened sacs enclosed by a membrane with ribosomes on the surface. RER folds and processes proteins

Smooth ER: series of membrane bound sacs. SER produces and processes lipids

Golgi apparatus: processes and packages proteins and lipids. Also produces Lysosomes

Mitochondria: Inner membrane folded to form projections called cristae with the matrix on the inside containing all the enzymes needed for respiration

Ribosomes: site of protein production

Lysosome: vesicle containing digestive enzymes bound by a single membrane

Protein transport: RER —> Golgi apparatus —> Vesicle —> required organelle/exocytosis

Cell wall: made of peptidoglycan

Capsule: protective slimy layer which helps the cell to retain moisture and adhere to surfaces

Plasmid: circular piece of DNA

Pili: hair-like structures that attach to other bacterial cells
