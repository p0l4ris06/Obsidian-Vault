A plant adapted to living in dry conditions

#### Adaptations:
- Leaf is rolled longitudinally so that humid air is trapped inside, reducing [[water]] loss
- Thick waxy cuticle on the outer side of the rolled leaf to reduce evaporation
- Leaves are reduced to spines, reducing the surface area of the leaves
- Stem is green for [[Photosynthesis]] (contains [[Chloroplast]]s)
- Can be succulents ()
