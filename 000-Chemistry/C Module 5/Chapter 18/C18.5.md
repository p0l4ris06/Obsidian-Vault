## The effect of temperature on [[Rate constant]]s
- When temp increases, two factors contribute to the increased [[Rate of reaction]] and [[Rate constant]]
- Increasing the temp shifts the [[Boltzmann distribution]] to the right, increasing the proportion of particles that exceed the [[Activation energy]] (E<sub>a</sub>)
